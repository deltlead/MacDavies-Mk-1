# MacDavies-Suppressor

  The goal of this project is to develop a 100%-90% 3D printable suppressor for use on 9mm and .22LR firearms. As with any NFA item, before building one of these you need to apply for a tax stamp to stay legal. While the primary material will be PLA from a 3D printer, certain design considerations may require a metal fitting to adapt the suppressor to the barrel in order to deal with barrel heat degrading the suppressor at the threads.

##  Project Goals:
1. Develop a suppressor that is able to mitigate the noise of super sonic small calliber projectiles fired from pistols.
3. Withstand at least 20x .22LR cartridges being fired through it within 30 seconds.
4. Fire more than 1500x .22LR cartridges before failure.

##  Versions:
- Mk 1: Initial designs. None have been manufactured yet and so haven't been tested.
- Mk 2: These designs have been manufactured and tested with live ammo, preliminary revisions being made to adjust for issues that arise during testing.
- Mk 3: Completed version, issues have been corrected and new changes have been added to increase performance of the design beyond the minimum requirements.

##  Mark vs Mod:
Mark Denotes a stage of the development process. Mod denotes a version iteration occuring within a stage of the design process. The last mod of a Mk usually becomes the first mod of the next Mk.

##  Concepts to be experimented with to improve performance:
- Wet Can: Using water or grease to cool the expanding gasses as they enter the suppressor volume. This should increase noise suppression and potentially improve the longevity of the material by helping to reduce thermal shock to the baffles
- Salt Packed Annealing: By completing filling the suppressor with powdered salt (till it is tightly packed) you can reduce deformation caused by annealing plastics. Annealing will help improve the strength and thermal tolerances of the material by molding the extruded layers of plastic into one continuous piece.
- "Pachinko" Block: To create terbulence by placing obstructions in the flow path of the expanding gases, the "Pachinko Effect" as I am now calling it and will continue to do so until someone tells me otherwise, creates randomness in the fluid flow, creating turbulence and greatly decreasing the gas velocity. Holes that go from the bore to the outer area vent gass off of the bore and creates flow paths that are perpendicular to the bore.
