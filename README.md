# MacDavies-Mk-1

  The goal of this project is to develop a 100%-90% 3D printable suppressor for use on 9mm and .22LR firearms. As with any NFA item, before building one of these you need to apply for a tax stamp to stay legal. While the primary material will be PLA from a 3D printer, certain design considerations may require a metal fitting to adapt the suppressor to the barrel in order to deal with barrel heat degrading the suppressor at the threads.

  Project Goals:
1. Develop a suppressor that is able to mitigate the noise of super sonic small calliber projectiles fired from pistols.
2. Withstand at least 10x 9mm pistol cartridges being fired through it within 30 seconds.
3. Withstand at least 30x .22LR cartridges being fired through it within 30 seconds.
4. Fire more than 1000x .22LR cartridges before failure.
5. Fire more than 200x 9mm cartridges before failure.

  Versions:
Mk 1: Initial prototype model, not expected to handle 9mm cartridges, should be able to meet .22LR requirements.
Mk 2: Improvements on the Mk 1, better lifespan and thermal capabilities. Address predicted issues like pressure from the cartridges wearing out the baffles quicker. Should meet or be very close to meeting all requirements.
Mk 3: Completed version, should meet or exceed all requirements.
