  Mk 1 Mod 1 Changes:
- Increased the number of baffles.
- Increased the diameter of the tube.
- Decreased the number of baffle holes and staggered them to prevent there being a straight hole through all of the baffles except for the bore.
- Removed the 3D printed threading. Will opt for a tap and die set in 1/2x28TPI for a more consistent and simpler thread job. The threaded part is now just a 15/32 hole where threads can be tapped in directly or a metal insert which could be inserted. If I am able to find a metal insert that fits the parameters, one made of brass specifically would be best for its thermal properties.
